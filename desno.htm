  <p align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The association <strong>APSOLUTNO</strong> was founded in 1993 in Novi Sad, 
    Yugoslavia. The production of the association is created through collaboration 
    of its four members ( Zoran Pantelic, Dragan Rakic, Bojana Petric (and Dragan 
    Miletic from 1995 till 2001) ). Since 1995 the works have been signed APSOLUTNO, 
    without any reference to personal names.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    production of <strong>APSOLUTNO</strong> started in the field of fine arts. 
    Gradually, it has developed to include not only aesthetic, but also cultural, 
    social and political aspects. The work of <strong>APSOLUTNO</strong> is based 
    on an interdisciplinary research into reality, with the aim to make it open 
    to new readings.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
    choice of medium is a very important part of the creative process, as <strong>APSOLUTNO</strong> 
    regards the medium as an equally relevant element of the work. <strong>APSOLUTNO</strong> 
    is a collective of three members, dealing with interdisciplinary art work 
    and media pluralism. </font></p>

  <p align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
    1995 APSOLUTNO started a project entitled 1995:2000 which was to last until 
    the end of the century and millennium. The project relied on the hyperbole 
    which regards the end of the millennium as something significant, alarming 
    or thrilling. </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Looking 
    back into history, it can be seen that this obsession with the potentially 
    dramatic end of the century or millennium has been permanently present in 
    one form or another: as an obsession with the end of the world, with cataclysm, 
    with the Judgement Day and, more recently, with the expansion of black holes. 
    Whenever one prophesy failed to come true, a new version appeared with an 
    even more tragic vision of the end of the world. A great number of examples 
    illustrate this phenomenon: D'Orbigny points to 27 predicted catastrophes 
    in the course of history, while E. de Beaumont cites 32 such predictions (The 
    Encyclopedia of the Lexicographic Institute, Zagreb MCMLXIII ). </font></p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
    the project 1995:2000, APSOLUTNO used calendar numerals as a signature for 
    their . Thus, all works created in 1995 were signed 1995 APSOLUTNO 0005, those 
    created in the following year were signed 1996 APSOLUTNO 0004 and so on. The 
    annual production of the association was related to the Gregorian calendar, 
    an arbitrary but widespread system of reckoning time. By signing projects 
    in this way, APSOLUTNO aimed to emphasise the dramatic aspects of the coming 
    encounter with the end of the century and millennium. </font></p>
  <div align="left"><font color="#666666" size="-2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>APSOLUTNO</strong> 
    made a <strong>subjective inventory </strong> of events, ideas and influences 
    that marked the last five years of the century and millennium. By exploring 
    the <strong>'absolutely now and absolutely here' </strong> APSOLUTNO aimed 
    to pose questions, create metaphors and point to absurd situations and paradoxes 
    brought by the time we lived in. </font></div>
