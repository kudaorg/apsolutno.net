The project relies on the hyperbole which regards the end of the millennium as something significant, alarming or thrilling. <br><br>Looking back into history, it can be seen that this obsession with the potentially dramatic end of the century or millennium has been permanently present in one form or another: as an obsession with the end of the world, with cataclysm, with the Judgement Day and, more recently, with the expansion of black holes. Whenever one prophesy failed to come true, a new version appeared with an even more tragic vision of the end of the world. A great number of examples illustrate this phenomenon: D'Orbigny points to 27 predicted catastrophes in the course of history, while E. de Beaumont cites 32 such predictions.<br><br>In the project 1995:2000, APSOLUTNO utilise calendar numerals as a signature for their works. Thus, all works created in 1995 were signed 1995 APSOLUTNO 0005, those created in the following year were signed 1996 APSOLUTNO 0004 and so on. By setting the annual production in the context of conventional counting, APSOLUTNO aims to emphasise the dramatic aspects of the coming encounter with the end of the century and millennium.<br><br>However, the essence of the time reference in the production of APSOLUTNO is not carried by the numerical signs themselves, but rather by their interaction with the content they sign. Projects by APSOLUTNO are, in fact, responses to phenomena occurring in particular places at a particular time. The time reference is, therefore, present in the production of APSOLUTNO not only in its physical, but also in its sociological aspect. By exploring the 'absolutely now and absolutely here' APSOLUTNO creates metaphors for the time we live in, aiming to examine to what extent the fear of the coming ( - perhaps the final?) is justified.<br><p>In 1996 APSOLUTNO started cooperation with SKC, the Student Cultural Centre, Novi Sad. Since then,APSOLUTNO has realised a number of projects in the production of SKC.<strong><p><center>Contact: <br>art association APSOLUTNO <br>Milana Rakica 15,<br>YU-21000 Novi Sad<br>phone/fax: ++381 21 23 391<br>fax: c/o APSOLUTNO ++381 21 27 296<br>e-mail: <a href="mailto: apsolutno@apsolutno.org">apsolutn@EUnet.yu</a></center></strong></font></p></td><td width=3%></td></tr></table></body></html>
