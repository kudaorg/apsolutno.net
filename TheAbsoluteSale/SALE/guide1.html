There are no code words or signs that only experienced    bidders are able to interpret. The language is clear and direct, and the steady pacing    gives everyone bidding plenty of time to respond. For your peace of mind, you can feel    free to click the mouse at any icon - it will not be taken as a bid.&nbsp; </p>    <p><i>What do I have to know before participating in this auction?&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; </p>    <p>We want you to be an informed buyer, so our database will provide you with a detailed    description of every offer together with an estimated price range. Feel free to search our    database for each of the lots offered for sale as thoroughly as you wish for each of the    lots offered for sale. You can also address our specialists by clicking &quot;Sale    Enquiries&quot;, to obtain any additional information you might want.&nbsp; <br>    &nbsp; </p>    <p align="center"><i>Is there any risk involved in buying at this auction?</i>&nbsp; We    must warn you that the lots at this paraticular auction are not available for pre-auction    inspection, due to their specific nature. Please read the following warning    carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>    <p align="center"><font COLOR="#FF0000"><blink>WARNING !!!</blink>&nbsp;</font></p>    <p align="center"><font COLOR="#FF0000">The database material about the lots offered for    sale is based upon information which we consider reliable, but because it has been    supplied by third parties, we cannot guarantee that it is accurate or complete, and it    should not be relied upon as such. The following offers are subject to errors, omissions,    change of price or withdrawal without notice.&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; </p>    <p><i>How does the auction work?&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; </p>    <p>When the auction begins, our auctioneer will introduce the lot for sale and open the    bidding at about one-half of its low estimated value. Once the first bid is placed, the    auctioneer usually asks for higher bids in increments of 10 percent or less over the    previous bid placed. For example, if the initial bid is for $1,000, the auctioneer would    ask for new bids of $1,100; after that $1,200 and so on. The current bid is displayed    prominently in all major currencies on a display board. What are the auction estimates?    The pre-sale estimates are intended as a guide for prospective buyers. Any bid between the    listed figures would, in our opinion, offer a fair chance of success. However, all lots,    depending on the degree of competition, can realise prices either above or below the    listed estimates.&nbsp; <br>    &nbsp; </p>    <p><i>How do I make a bid?</i>&nbsp; </p>    <p>Due to the specific nature of the lots offered at this auction, we cannot provide you    with information on this topic.You will be instructed at the beginning of the auction    itself.&nbsp; <br>    &nbsp; </p>    <p><i>Is the highest bid the final price?</i>&nbsp; </p>    <p align="center">The final price of your purchase is determined by adding our customary    Buyer's Premium to your bid, plus the sales tax. However, if you are paying in cash, there    will be no tax added to your bid.&nbsp; May we conclude by saying that this is the right    moment for you to make an investment into the values of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>    <p align="center"><blink>We wish you every success in this auction!&nbsp;</blink>&nbsp; </p>    <p align="center">Are you ready to go to the <a href="lots.html"><font color="#FF0000"><u>lots</u></font></a>,    or do you want to go to the <a href="index.html"><font color="#FF0000"><u>back</u></font></a>    home page?</td>  </tr></table></center></div></body></html>
