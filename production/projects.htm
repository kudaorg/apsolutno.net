  <p align="left"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>The late  1990s were a time of intense activity, networking and East-West collaboration  in contemporary arts in the former Eastern Europe.  Discovery of new fields of art practice, redefinition of one's position as an  artist in a climate of changing social, political and cultural contexts, the  establishment of new systems of communication and collaboration, and the  emergence of new technologies in art practices all marked that period.  Association APSOLUTNO was part of that wider scene, which was in stark contrast  to the claustrophobic context of Serbia within which the members of  APSOLUTNO lived and within which the production of the association was created.</p>
  <p>This book  is an&nbsp; <em>Absolute Report </em>&nbsp;of the last five years of the 20. century from  the perspective of a specific artistic network that was active at that time. We  present the projects that APSOLUTNO created in that period as well as <em>reports</em> by various artists, media thinkers and other important personalities that  APSOLUTNO met within the same East-West network in the sphere of new art &amp;  media practices. In this book we find parallels between our own projects and  those of others, by identifying four important themes that run through the work  created at that time: time, space, code, and memory. </p>
  <p>These  themes arose in the work of APSOLUTNO as a response to the immediate social  surroundings in which APSOLUTNO lived and worked. The guiding principle of  APSOLUTNO was search for the sites and situations with a symbolic or  metaphorical potential in relation to a wider social context. We refer to these  found&nbsp; situations as <em>absolutely real  facts</em> because of their hidden interpretive quality. Taking <em>absolutely  real facts</em> as a starting point for our interventions, we turned the  familiar, usual, or even marginal, which is often no longer even perceived,  into something unusual, out of the ordinary, and worth further exploration. </p>
  <p>Time,  space, code and memory are also present in the works by other participants  represented in this book. In spite of the variety of approaches, it is evident  that this activity, taken as a whole, reflects the existence of a specific  epistemological community. </p>

  <p><strong>Reading</strong><strong> room<br>
  </strong>As reading is primarily a solitary process, we want to create silent,  autonomous, spaces for reading, browsing, research and reflection. The reading  room will therefore contain 6 to 8 reading boxes, physically separated by  transparent curtains. The books will be placed on shelves within these boxes.  Therefore, the user has to search for the books by entering the boxes. Books  should ideally be sorted by topics (but it is also possible to sort them  alphabetically) and information about the contents of each box will be visible  on the outside of the boxes. Thus, the user makes decisions which boxes s/he  wants to enter.</p>
  <p>To create an atmosphere of a radio studio, the walls in the reading room  will be covered by blocks of black sponge, thus emphasizing the idea of a  silent space. This will also make the room darker. In contrast, the reading  boxes will be brightly lit by reading lamps, signifying spaces of intense  activity. Each box will have a red light bulb on top of it, with &ldquo;on-air&rdquo; /  &ldquo;off-air&rdquo; signs. As the reader enters the reading box, the on-air sign switches  on (activated by a photo sensor), signaling that reading activity is taking  place and also indicated to other readers that the activity should not be  interrupted. (As the curtain is transparent, it will be visible when the box is  occupied). When the reader leaves the reading box, the sign switches to  &ldquo;off-air&rdquo;.<br>
    <strong>Computer  room<br>
  </strong>The idea for the computer room is to create a space not only for  consuming information through the archive and the internet but also for  exchange of information. Therefore, the walls of the room will be covered by  white wall-paper, with links to sites about the radio printed on them, and also  with spaces for users to add the sites they consider important or interesting.  Markers will be provided for that purpose.</p>
  <p align="left">The computer room follows the same layout as the reading room: the  computers are placed along the three walls. In the middle of the room, as a  central meeting point, is the CD and DVD archive, placed in a box whose front  side and top is covered in the same wall paper as the walls. That way the users  can write down their favorite links on the box as well, as they come to take or  return the materials from the archive.<br>

    In 
    this installation the three buildings of the military clothes<br>
    factory in Hiroshima are marked as 'museum artefacts' as they are<br>
    witnesses to a historical event. Association APSOLUTNO includes these<br>
    buildings into the inventory of the 'absolutely real facts' of the 20th<br>
    century. This site thus becomes a point of special significance for our<br>
    civilization, which opens up questions about un/acceptability in the<br>
    context of the past and the present.<br>

    SERBEIKO 
    is a video-installation which represents a strong association of reading of 
    times. It is an authentic interpretation of social circumstances in Yugoslavia/Serbia. 
    At the same time this video installation emphasizes an ironic perspective 
    on the absolutely exact (Serbian) time. As a direct associative connection 
    of the precise control of time, the well-known logotype of the famous Japanese 
    company SEIKO was taken as a basic platform for the title of the installation. 
    The name SEIKO was visually transformed into SERBEIKO - this enabled perseverance 
    of the sound association of the name of the installation in relation to the 
    original sample. As a metaphor of an absolutely real fact (arf), in this video 
    installation was used a computer and graphic animation of the clock-image 
    taken from the state television broadcasting - RTS (Radio Television of Serbia).<br>
    SERBEIKO 
    was shown for the first time at the exhibition &quot;INSOMNIA&quot; in January 
    2000 in Belgrade.<br>
    The 
    premiere of the video screening took place at the Belgrade Festival of the 
    Short and Documentary Film in March 2000. <br>

    <br>
    <strong>Concept of the installation 1999 aA 0001</strong></p>
  <p>The 
    starting idea for the installation for the VEAG building media facade was 
    the notion of energy, the main product of VEAG. In the installation association<br>
    APSOLUTNO aims to point out both the energy produced, controlled and used 
    by man, and also the energy of a human being and its creative potential. This 
    idea is developed in the installation through a number of complementary elements: 
    man - machine, black - white, letter - number, sound - movement. The idea 
    can also be seen on the level of the realization of the video sequence, which 
    includes a graphic animation on the one hand and a filming of an actor on 
    the other.</p>
  <p>The 
    installation is clearly divided into two complementary sets of screens: horizontal 
    and vertical, taking into account the architecture of the building and the 
    position of the screens. While each set of screens has its independent existence 
    as a visual whole, both of them together represent a dynamic composition with 
    a specific rhythm of both synchronised and separate sections. As the architecture 
    of the VEAG building gives an impression of solidity and stability, with its 
    emphasized vertical elements, our idea is for the installation<br>
    to create an effect of the building in movement: at one moment in the horizontal 
    screens the 'generators' start moving faster and faster, which will create 
    an illusion that the building is moving on its &quot;wheels&quot;.</p>
  <p>Taking 
    into account that the installation will be viewed from various distances and 
    perspectives, a passer-by walking on the pavement, a driver in a<br>
    passing car or a passenger on a bus will see the video wall as an animation 
    sequence at different speeds.</p>
  <p>The 
    whole installation rests on the minimalist principle and simple aesthetics 
    as a contrast to the present hyper-production of video clips full of various 
    high-tech effects. In the medium itself, there are two complementary elements, 
    reflecting the main idea of the installation: graphic computer animation (machine) 
    and a filmed actor (man). <br>
    The installation is realized in three colours only: black, white and red; 
    black and white as symbols of two opposite poles, and red symbolizing energy.<br>
    <strong><br>
    Description of the installation</strong></p>
  <p>There 
    are two segments of the installation:<br>
    horizontal screens make up one, while the vertical screens make up the other. 
    The whole installation is based on the interplay between what is going on 
    in<br>
    these two parts. For the purposes of clarity, the description of the installation 
    will be given in steps.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Step 
    1</strong></p>
  <p>Horizontal 
    screens<br>
    Mouth of a man (zoom), black and white. The person is uttering the sounds 
    of the German alphabet. One can recognize the sounds if closer attention is 
    paid<br>
    to the movements of the lips. The screens show the same video sequence but 
    not in synhronisation. When in one of the screens the mouth utters again the<br>
    sound A, it stops with the alphabet and continues uttering the sound A only. 
    Gradually, on all screens one can see the same mouth uttering the sound A.</p>
  <p>Vertical 
    screens<br>
    All the screens are white. Black letters, of all sizes and typographic shapes, 
    start appearing on the surface, as if falling onto it. They appear in random<br>
    order, creating a graphic dynamics. As these black letters 'fall' onto the 
    white surface, one over the other, the surface gradually becomes black. At 
    the<br>
    moment when all horizontal screens show the same picture (the mouth uttering 
    the sound A), all the vertical screens are black.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Step 
    2</strong></p>
  <p>Horizontal 
    screens<br>
    The mouth uttering the sound A forms the shape of a circle. At one moment, 
    on all the horizontal screens, the circle of the mouth is replaced with the 
    circle of a cross section of a generator. The starting position is static: 
    a white drawing on the black screen. Gradually, on all the screens, at the 
    same time, the generators start to roll. The movement is faster and faster 
    until the generators start spinning and becoming red. Red colour gradually 
    covers all the horizontal screens.</p>
  <p>Vertical 
    screens<br>
    On the black screens, just like previously letters, now there are displays 
    with numbers appearing on the black surface. All the displays are red. In 
    the same<br>
    way, the numbers fall onto the black surface making it red. The displays appear 
    on the screen at the speed and dynamics which matches the speed of the<br>
    generators in the horizontal screens. Gradually, all the vertical screens 
    become red, so now all 18 screens are red.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Step 
    3</strong></p>
  <p>Horizontal 
    screens<br>
    The red screens disappear one by one, starting from the left (like sound display 
    - led netter). At the same time, the mouth appears again in each of the screens 
    and starts uttering the alphabet. When all the screens show the mouth, the 
    whole sequence starts again.</p>
  <p>Vertical 
    screens<br>
    In the same way, the red screens disappear one by one and are replaced by 
    white screens. When all the screens are white, the whole sequence starts again.</p>

  </span>    The Semiotics of Confusion.  In: Kovats, S. (Ed.), /Ost-West Internet. Media Revolution. Electronic Media in the Transformation Process of Eastern and Central Europe/  (pp.242-255). Edition Bauhaus - Band 6. Frankfurt/New    York: Campus Verlag 
  <p align="center"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
  <p>The idea for this piece of writing arose from the visual research  association APSOLUTNO conducted from 1995 to 1998. The research was focused on  the national symbols in official use in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  during that time. APSOLUTNO documented flags, border-markers, coats-of-arms and  other national and state symbols, banknotes, passports and other official  documents issued by the authorities, as well as various public individual  responses to these. In addition to this visual material, other symbols and  reactions to them were documented as well (e.g., the reactions of the audience  to the national anthem played at international sport events). This text will be  based on a segment of the visual part of the documentation.</p>
  <p>The aim of this action of documenting was to record a phenomenon in our  immediate surroundings by collecting <strong><em>absolutely  real facts</em></strong> here and now. It is important to note that the absolutely  real facts are arbitrary to a certain extent, determined by the time and place  where they were collected (on various irregular occasions from 1995 to 1998, in  Novi Sad and Belgrade, Yugoslavia).  They nevertheless illustrate the variety of semiotic activities, both official  and individual, which in an interesting way reflect (sometimes follow,  sometimes anticipate) events in the social and political sphere. </p>
  <p>The reason why this text has no conclusion is very simple: the state of  affairs in this area is still in flux and as we are writing, the confusion is  only being multiplied.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><span class="style11">I</span></h1>
  <p>Since 1991 five new states have emerged on the territory of  ex-Yugoslavia, and it is very likely that this process has still not been  completed. On the semiotic level, this process of disintegration and formation  has been followed and in some cases preceded by feverish symbol-engineering:  old national and state symbols have been discarded, ancient ones revived or  recycled and completely new ones designed. New authorities attached enormous  significance to the introduction of new symbols, as through these it was  possible to create a new sense of national identity, national pride and a new  political and ideological framework for future orientation. In other words, the  change on the symbolic level was seen as an important vehicle of political  change, as communication via symbols was a language that people understood and  to which they responded.</p>
  <p>The urgency and importance of the introduction of new national symbols  are easy to illustrate if the dates when laws regulating the use of national  symbols were passed are compared with the dates when the new states were  officially established. In Croatia,  for example, the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Croatia was amended  in July 1990, when the word<em> socialist </em>was  dropped from the name of the country, the red star removed from the country's  national flag and the socialist coat-of-arms replaced by Croatia's  historical coat-of-arms. Law on the Coat-of-Arms, the Flag, and the National  Anthem of the Republic   of Croatia was adopted in  Parliament on 21 December 1990. A day later, on 22December, Croatia passed  a new constitution, which allowed for secession from the former Yugoslav  Federation.<em>i</em></p>
  <p>The process was similar in Slovenia, which declared itself a  sovereign state on 25 June 1991 and, at the same time, introduced a new flag  and coat-of-arms. On that day the new flag was hoisted officially for the first  time in front of the Slovenian Parliament, and beside it, the old flag with the  red star was lowered, in a symbolic gesture of replacement.<em>ii</em></p>
  <p>However, this process of changing national and state symbols was not  always clear and straightforward. In some cases it meandered, touching upon  various issues and sometimes coming across unexpected reactions internally or  externally. Problems in the semiotic area only reflected either external  pressures (as in Macedonia),  or the unresolved issues within the state itself (Bosnia), or they indicated a basic  lack of a clear idea about the future direction (FRY). We shall briefly give an  overview of some of the related issues, focusing on the flag as one of the  central national and state symbols, and excluding for the moment the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
  <p>As already mentioned, in Slovenia  and Croatia,  the national flags used in those countries while they were part of the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (tricolours with the red star)  continued to be used after the removal of the red star. However, in Macedonia and Bosnia completely new flags had to  be designed.</p>
  <p>In Macedonia,  a new flag was adopted at independence in August 1992. The design was selected  from more than a hundred proposals which entered an open competition. The flag  immediately came under attack from Greece, which maintained that the  Vergina Sun, the central symbol on the flag, belonged to Greek cultural  heritage. Greece also  protested against the use of the word <em>Macedonia</em> as the official name of the new state. The dispute was resolved in 1995 by a UN  agreement<em>iii</em>, according to  which Macedonia  was recognised as &quot;The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; and was  required to design a new flag within 30 days. The present flag of Macedonia,  proposed by a group of Members of Parliament, was finally adopted in 1995,  three years after independence. Nevertheless, the name of the country remains  temporary.</p>
  <p>In Bosnia and    Herzegovina, the current flag was adopted in  February 1998 by UN High Representative Carlos Westendorp. Prior to this, there  had been a long process of designing and selecting an appropriate flag. The  first flag, adopted in 1992, before the war in Bosnia  broke out, bore a fleur-de-lis as the central symbol, a symbol associated with  the Muslim tradition in Bosnia,  and was therefore to be replaced following the Dayton Peace Accord and the  recognition of Bosnia and    Herzegovina as a tripartite state (1995).  After several years and numerous proposals<em>iv</em>,  the Bosnian Parliament still could not reach agreement on a solution that would  be acceptable to all three national entities. Finally, in 1998, UN High Representative  Westendorp appointed an expert commission which designed three proposals. After  the Parliament failed once again to adopt any of these, the High Representative  selected a flag for Bosnia    and Herzegovina himself. The flag bears the  colours of the European Union, without any national symbols, since, as  explained by Duncan Bullivant, Office of the High Representative (at the press  conference at which the new flag was presented): &ldquo;This flag is a flag of the  future. It represents unity not division; it is the flag that belongs in  Europe&rdquo;.<em>v</em> The inability of  the Parliament to find common ground and the imposition of the solution by  external authorities only emphasised the fragility of Dayton Bosnia and  questioned the possibilities of its existence.</p>
  <p>As this brief overview shows, the establishment of new national symbols  in the countries formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia  reflected the political processes in these countries. Periods of confusion in  politics were mirrored by periods of semiotic confusion; likewise, political  solutions that were initially considered final were succeeded by final  decisions about the design of national symbols.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>II</strong> </p>
  <p>If we look at the national symbols of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or  Serbia-Montenegro, (since the domestic official title has not received  widespread recognition), the first point to note is that the authorities have  been extremely hesitant in replacing the national symbols of the Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Unlike the other states in the Balkans, FRY did  not regard it as important to invest much effort or resources into creating a  new semiotic reality for its citizens.</p>
  <p>The new constitution, which marked the beginning of the 'third' Yugoslavia, was  adopted in April 1992. The Federal    Republic of Yugoslavia clearly demonstrated  an aspiration to represent a continuation as the sole successor to the  Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the same time, changes were to be  introduced in the political, ideological and national domain, supposedly  responding to the general public's dissatisfaction with the old system. This  tension between the intention to be regarded as a continuation of the old and,  at the same time, as the bearer of the new is also visible on the semiotic  level.</p>
  <p>Although the red star was removed from the national flag, it remained in  use much longer, even up to today, on most official documents, as well as on  public buildings. For example, the red star on the City Hall in Belgrade was removed only  in 1997, when the opposition parties came to power after the local elections.  Similarly, passports of the former Yugoslavia are still in official  use in 1999, together with the new ones, which were introduced as late as in  1997. ID cards still bear the former Yugoslavia's coat-of-arms, with the  red star and six torches representing the six republics of the former  federation, although the new coat-of-arms was introduced in 1994. The national  anthem of the former Yugoslavia is still used as the national anthem of today&rsquo;s  Yugoslavia, to which certain parts of the society are strongly opposed.<em>vii</em> As for national holidays,  although new ones have been introduced, the holidays of the former Yugoslavia  are still officially celebrated, including the Day of the Republic, the day  when the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was formed (29 November  1943).</p>
  <p>To sum up, at first glance, it would appear that there have been two  opposing directions during the last ten years in FRY as far as the national  symbols are concerned: one towards change; the other towards maintaining the  existing symbolic structure of the SFRY. However, if we look closer into the  symbols that have been changed, it is not difficult to notice that the change  referred mostly to the removal of the red star. This gesture was in accordance  with the general atmosphere in the whole of Eastern Europe,  a gesture which could not provoke public dissent. It was an expected change,  and therefore neutral, insignificant, a change on the surface without any real  consequences &ndash; in the same way as the ruling Communist Party changed its name  to the Socialist Party, while its protagonists have remained the same.  Nevertheless, in terms of changes which would indicate a possible future  direction, or which would give a new identity to the nation, little has been  done. The reasons certainly lie in the lack of a clear political vision, or  more precisely lack of any vision whatsoever. Or is it a ploy to deliberately  create a state of confusion in the minds of the people? What does the political  establishment communicate to the nation through these symbols? Does it convey  the message that FRY is a new country or a continuation of the SFRY? And  consequently, are people living in that country now a different nation?</p>
  <p>Rather than analyzing the deeper meanings behind these semiotic  activities, we shall now turn to examples of semiotic actions by citizens, or  politically aware visual activism by individuals who have felt the need to  express their views in a specific form &ndash; through interventions on the license  plates on their cars. These gestures, which range from anger to humour, some  creative and some stereotypical, illustrate the pragmatic force of symbols,  i.e., the power of symbols to trigger actual, concrete, physical responses.  Through these responses, it is perhaps possible to gain an insight into some  answers to the questions above, namely, how these people respond to what they  interpret that the semiotic reality imposed by the establishment communicates  to them.</p>
  <p align="center"><strong>III</strong></p>
  <p>License plates on vehicles in the former Yugoslavia contained three  elements: a letter code for the town where the vehicle was registered, the red  star, and the registration number. New license plates differ from the old ones  only in that the red star is replaced by theYugoslav flag (blue-white-red  tricolour). Although the new plates were introduced in 1998, the old ones are  still in use, and since the new plates were still a novelty at the time when  this material was being collected, no cases of intervention on them were  recorded.</p>
  <p>To start with the most common type of intervention: denial of the red  star. Numerous examples show license plates with the red star erased, destroyed  or covered with adhesive tape (see pictures 1, 2 ).<br>
    <img src="slikeprojects/sem1.jpg" width="250" height="150"> (picture 1) <br>
    <br>
    <img src="slikeprojects/sem2.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 2)<br>
    <br>
    Another group of examples shows license plates in which the red star  remains, but the stickers on the car reveal the person&rsquo;s view on what the  orientation of the country should be. It is important to note that the only  official sticker for FRY is YU. In the first example (picture 3),<br>
    <br>
    <img src="slikeprojects/sem3.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 3)<br>
    <br>
  the person  would obviously like to live in a country whose name would be Serbia, rather than Yugoslavia  (sticker SER, plus the colours of the flag of Serbia: red-blue-white). The second  example (picture 4)<br>
  <br>
  <img src="slikeprojects/sem4.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 4)<br>
  <br>
  shows a case of a local patriot within the old boundaries &ndash;  the sticker V, which stands for Vojvodina, the northern province of Serbia, is  accompanied by the sticker YU, unlike the example in picture 2, where the  province is the preference for identification (an independent Vojvodina?). The  third plate in this group (picture 5)<br>
  <br>
  <img src="slikeprojects/sem5.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 5)<br>
  <br>
  is an example of wishful thinking, or a  humorous response to the general situation in the country &ndash; Yugoslavia as a  member of the European Union.</p>
  <p>The third group of reactions offers ideas for alternatives to the red  star. Not a great variety of solutions has been found.Picture 6 shows a  Serbian tricolour in the place of the red star, <br>
    <br>
    <img src="slikeprojects/sem6.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 6)<br>
    <br>
  while picture 7 is even more  explicit in that direction,<br>
  <br>
  <img src="slikeprojects/sem7.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 7)<br>
  <br>
   featuring both the flag of Serbia and the  Serbian historical coat-of-arms. What is particularly interesting in this  example is that the car was not registered in Serbia,  but in Montenegro, whose  capital, Podgorica, was previously called Titograd  (Tito City), hence TG. Finally, we present a  response which is neither nationally nor territorially based (picture 8), where  the red star is replaced by the red heart.<br>
  <br>
  <img src="slikeprojects/sem8.jpg" width="250" height="150">(picture 8)</p>
  <p>It would be simplistic to say that these responses are based on  interpretations of the meaning of the red star. The meaning of a symbol is not  a precisely defined category; its boundaries are fuzzy and in constant flux,  depending upon the context and paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations of the  symbol with other symbols and the interpreter her/himself. It would be more  precise to say that these reactions are based on the interpretation of the  meaning of the fact that the red star was still the official mark on license  plates in FRY in the late 1990s.</p>
  <p>The red star was a dominant symbol in Eastern   Europe for fifty years; it not only represented a vehicle of  expression of the dominant ideology, but also marked both the official and the  dissident culture of the whole period. That period ended in Eastern Europe with  the events which commenced with the fall of the Berlin Wall, and FRY was no  exception to the general feeling that a change had occurred: the mere fact that  these individuals felt they <em>could</em> desecrate the red star, once a sacred symbol, meant that there was a general  implicit consensus in the society that the era of the red star (in the sense of  what it meant in Eastern Europe) was over. This is why these semiotic actions  do not represent a serious violation of the order nor an act of rebellion, and  for the same reason, they were not treated as instances of punishable offence,  though in fact, that is what they would have been under 'regular'  circumstances.</p>
  <p>Rather, these semiotic gestures can be regarded as a specific form of  communication in which symbols have a central place, in a society where forms  of political dialogue have ceased to function or have become distorted. They  represent a sort of a public act, directed not to a specified address, but to  anyone who happens to see them. They express disagreement with the social  identity that belongs to the former period but is still maintained, and  dissatisfaction with the fact that a new identity is still non-existent. Some  of these gestures are personal statements of a particular national or  territorial identity and, though na&iuml;ve and politically inarticulate, they  indicate a need and search for a new sense of direction. The crisis of identity  and the lack of a sense of direction, which have persisted for nearly a decade  in FRY, have caused semiotic and various other confusions.</p>
  <p>As this text is being written, it seems that new flags are being  designed in the Balkans. It remains to be seen what <strong><em>absolutely real facts</em></strong> with their changing meanings will emerge.<br clear="all">

    The 
    idea for this piece originated during the 78 days of NATO's operation &quot;Allied 
    Forces &quot; in Yugoslavia. It features a film-still from the documentary 
    film &quot;The Last Oasis&quot;, which was shot in the early 80's, in the 
  Baranya County region of the former Yugoslavia, now the Republic of Croatia. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    film reveals the beauty and diversity in one of the largest wildlife refuges 
    on the Balkan Peninsula, which has become endangered by industrial and agricultural 
    development, as well as human disrespect for nature in general. Situated between 
    the rivers Danube and Drava, the Oasis' marshes attract a variety of species, 
    some extinct from the rest of the European Continent. </p>
  <p align="left">On 
    October 13, 1967 the area, known as Kopacki rit, was declared a Nature Park 
    (17,770 ha), including the Special Zoological Reserve (6,234 ha) protected 
    since May 14, 1969. With great admiration for this small but vibrant ecosystem, 
    director Petar Lalovic passionately explores the Oasis and reminds us of the 
    times when wildlife was thriving in this part of Europe. The title of this 
    film is a pivotal reference, revealing a complex narrative structure. </p>
  <p align="left">Consider 
    when the film was made and recent events in the Oasis. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    early 1980's in the Yugoslav political arena were very dynamic and occasionally 
    eruptive after 35 years of an iron regime. In May 1980 Marshal Tito died. 
    From today's perspective his death can be seen as a turning point; after years 
    of a progressive and comfortable socialist era, Tito's death hastened the 
    separation of the six Yugoslav republics into five new countries. Many see 
    Marshal Tito as the single authority figure that kept post WWII Yugoslavia 
    together. Coincidentally, Tito was an avid hunter who enjoyed this noble activity 
    in the region where &quot;The Last Oasis&quot; was filmed. </p>
  <p align="left">Positioned 
    in the middle of the Balkan Peninsula, on the outskirts of the Iron Curtain, 
    between the communist East and the capitalist West, Tito's Yugoslavia had 
    a unique position in the global community, a virtual Oasis with its own guiding 
    principle of self-management. Yugoslavia was part neither of the Warsaw Pact 
    nor of NATO. </p>
  <p align="left">Yugoslavia, 
    India and Egypt initiated the formation of Non Aligned Countries, at a summit 
    in Belgrade, September 1-6, 1961. Thirty-one years later, at the meeting of 
    Ministers of Non-Aligned Countries held in New York on 30 September 1992, 
    it was decided that Yugoslavia cannot contribute to and participate in the 
    activities of the NAM any longer. Yugoslavia, one of the initiators of the 
    NAM, ended up expelled from the organisation it had founded. Radical political 
    shifts like this one cyclically strike the Balkans. In this part of the world, 
    a socio-political trophy frequently transforms into atrophy. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    film-still chosen for this piece shows a scene with deer shedding its antlers. 
    This process occurs when the animal is aged and represents a turning point 
    in the animal's life. It also redefines the value of the horns. The animal's 
    pride and symbol of power is about to vanish. At the same time, the animal's 
    life is becoming much safer. Today, a male deer is primarily hunted for its 
    rustic horns, which are used for decorative purposes or to remember a successful 
    hunt. After the horns are shed, neither hunters nor collectors value them 
    as highly as if they were taken with the animal's skull. When found in nature, 
    antlers can be used for many purposes, but not as a trophy. Only a killed 
    animal is potentially a trophy. </p>
  <p align="left">A 
    deer hunt may last for days, and if a hunter faces this scene he/she may experience 
    enormous frustration. But for the camera and the director, this moment is 
    a sparkle of nature's magnitude, a real trophy, since it captures an extremely 
    rarely seen event in nature. It is an instant arrested, a pregnant moment 
    when everything tips over into a new framework of meanings. </p>
  <p align="left">Obviously, 
    the event itself carries antipodal references and the interpretation depends 
    on one's point of view and the given context. In this sense, the title of 
    the installation, a&middot;trophy, suggests certain readings of the image 
    and emphasizes the binary nature of the event beheld in the image (a trophy 
    signifies power and authority, whereas atrophy signifies loss or decay of 
    a system). When related to a certain political and military context, such 
    as the one we started working in, the reading of the image provides material 
    for drawing parallels and asking questions: what is a trophy and what is atrophy 
    in a wider socio-political sense? Similarly to the variety of possible interpretations 
    of the image, there is a variety of possible answers to these questions as 
    well. However, it is certain that the author of the Last Oasis had never anticipated 
    that this sequence would gain such a rich metaphorical significance and become 
    a trophy of an atrophy. </p>

    The Greatest Hits<a name="tgh"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<br>
    [To view webbed version of this CD-Rom project you need

    <br>
    The 
    Greatest Hits [TGH] is a CD Rom project which in an ironic way deals with 
    the idea of progress at the end of the millennium. This concept is developed 
    in two fields of human achievement, digital technology on the one hand and 
    medicine on the other, using the notion of a virus. Both computer and human 
    viruses are elements which disturb the balance in the system, computer or 
    human, however sophisticated and protected the system may be. The emergence 
    of a greater and greater number of both types of viruses at the end of the 
    millennium indicates the boomerang effect, i.e. the vulnerability of man and 
    technology despite the progress achieved. At the same time, virus is a phenomenon 
    that does not appear in an isolated system; it only occurs during an interaction 
    between either people or computers. Therefore, it might be said that virus 
    is a kind of a side-effect of communication. As our age is an age of communication, 
    it is also an age of viruses. Any communication carries a risk of contracting 
    a virus.<br>
    <br>
    The Greatest Hits [TGH] contains two TOP TEN lists of these two types of viruses, 
    composed according to the statistical data about their harmful effects (hits, 
    or blows which 'hit' the mankind).<br>
    <br>
    The project itself is conceived as a kind of a virus, which plays a game with 
    the viewer, and is, as any other virus, completely user-unfriendly. The user 
    has few possibilities of choice while moving through the CD Rom. In addition, 
    there is no exit option anywhere in the CD, alluding to the situation of no 
    escape in the course of the technological progress. The only two ways to exit 
    the project are either for the user to restart the computer, or to contract 
    the specially created virus, Absolutely Demo Virus [ADV], contained in both 
    TOP TEN lists.<br>

    </strong>The project Le Quattro Stagioni is the result 
    of a one-year action, which took place during the four seasons of 1996. In 
    each season, one member of the association was photographed in 19th century 
    costume. </p>
  <p align="left">All 
    four photos were taken on a site recognised by APSOLUTNO as a symbol for the 
    place and time we live in. This is a memorial cemetery where Soviet soldiers 
    were buried, situated on ground belonging to an Orthodox chapel. The communist 
    memorial and the orthodox chapel stand next to each other. Thus, in this place 
    two contrasting and co-existent symbols, the red star and the orthodox cross, 
    are juxtaposed.</p>
  <p align="left">The 
    members of APSOLUTNO are photographed as 19th century figures, looking forward 
    to the future. Their impatience to move into the next century is symbolised 
    in the bicycles they are all holding. In order to travel faster, they use 
    a device which is well-known locally: a corncob put into the bicycle wheel.    </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    photos were used as illustrations for the pseudo-calendar Le Quattro Stagioni, 
    in which dates are marked by numbers in an indication of of how many days 
    remain until the end of the century and millennium.<br>

    </strong>In 
    &quot;Time Out&quot; APSOLUTNO applied a strategy based on observation of, 
    and reaction to certain visual elements in the surroundings, chosen for their 
    richness of meaning. By intervening on such elements it is possible to achieve 
    specific conceptual as well as aesthetic effects. </p>
  <p align="left">In 
    the case of &quot;Time Out&quot; the perceived visual detail was a composition 
    on the wall of a building belonging to the Trinity Church, in Sombor, northern 
    Serbia. The composition consisted of a sundial on a mural with an inscription 
    in Serbian and Hungarian: &quot;One of these is your last one!&quot; </p>
  <p align="left">APSOLUTNO 
    responded to this warning by installing an awning above the sundial. By stopping 
    time in this way, a specific response was given to the inscription. <br>

    <br>
    In the sound installation instrumental the art association APSOLUTNO uses 
    two instruments, the letter and the bullet. The two notions are generally 
    regarded as antipodes; the letter personifying cultural values, literacy, 
    transmission of knowledge and communication, and the bullet standing for destruction, 
    devastation, communication breakdown. However, language as a powerful weapon 
    has always been misused and abused. In order to emphasise this, the art association 
    APSOLUTNO equates the letter with the bullet, two instruments which are too 
    often used for the same purpose.</p>
  <p>The 
    letter and the bullet in instrumental are not used as visual symbols, but 
    rather, as the title of the work suggests, as instrumental (aural) elements. 
    The common ground for these two antipodes was found in Morse code. In Morse 
    code, each letter is represented by a sign made up of one or more short signals 
    (dots) and long signals (dashes) in sound. In instrumental, APSOLUTNO replaced 
    short signals by the sound of shots (1 shot = 1 dot), and long signals by 
    machinegun fire (1 burst = 1 dash). <br>
    instrumental is a message encoded in Morse code. It is accessible by telephone, 
    from an answering machine installed on a telephone line. In this way, the 
    message is presented just like any other information given by public services.    </p>
  <p>The 
    information about the telephone number where the message is installed is printed 
    on cards, which are distributed in the exhibition space. Apart from the phone 
    number, the cards contain Morse code, so that the audience can decipher the 
    message.</p>
  <p>The 
    message begins with the announcement of a song - Lilli Marleen. The song is 
    played in its instrumental version, in which the lyrics are converted into 
    the sounds of shots and machinegun fire used as signs of Morse code. The radio 
    announcement at the beginning of the message is taken from the soundtrack 
    of Fasbinder's film &quot;Lilli Marleen&quot;. It refers to the historical 
    fact that this song was played for the first time from Radio Belgrad, in 1941. 
    At the end of the 'song' there is a quotation from Fasbinder's film, a sentence 
    spoken by Hanna Schigula, who plays Lilli Marleen in the film: &quot;Aber

    </strong>The 
    project &quot;Good Evening&quot; has been realized in the media of a video 
    and a booklet. Both parts focus on the role of the media at the end of the 
    20th century. While the video &quot;Good Evening&quot; makes reference to 
    the medium of television, the booklet &quot;Good Evening&quot; refers to the 
    medium of the press. The link between the two parts is established by the 
    use of the same sentence &quot;Good evening&quot; - the standard way tv news 
    readers address their viewers at the beginning of the news. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    sentence also implies the 'evening' of the century and millennium. In the 
    booklet, this sentence is written using the logos of the main daily newspapers, 
    in the corresponding languages. The only other element of the booklet is the 
    pagination, which, instead of numerals, consists of symbols used to mark moves 
    in a game of chess. After 32 moves, the same number as the number of pages 
    in this publication, this game of chess ends in a checkmate, a situation from 
    which escape is impossible.<br>

    </strong>The project HUMAN is focused on the global 
    events on the European territory. Marking the borderline which divides Europe 
    into East and West is in the basis of the project. This borderline has a long 
    history during which it has gone through a number of changes, but its meaning 
    always prevailed. This borderline exists as an invisible curtain which either 
    tolerates or prevents different forms of communication on various levels. 
    Since 1989 and the fall of the Berlin wall, we have been witnesses of a geopolitical 
    regrouping followed by the disappearance of borders between the states in 
    the western part and the establishment of the new &quot;united&quot; Europe, 
    while in the eastern part a multitude of new nationalistic states with strictly 
    controlled borders were formed. In this action the association APSOLUTNO marked 
    the above mentioned line (WE-EE) by placing a traffic sign with the inscription 
    &quot;MAN&quot; on no-man&#8217;s-land between the borders of the countries 
    along the line. Thus the association pointed out the (in)equality of PEOPLE 
    and their destinies in both of these entities of European territory. The word 
    HUMAN which is on the signs, is written in the official languages of the neighbouring 
    countries.<br>
    <br>
    The invisible borders<br>
    <br>
    Apart from marking the borderlines which divide Europe, parallel part of the 
    project HUMAN is recognition and marking of the &quot;invisible&quot; lines 
    which divide a geographical whole or an urban entity. The divisions instigated 
    by war, economic, legal, political or cultural disputes, cause a form of (un)communicativeness 
    between people. These borders carry psychological weight because unlike official 
    borders they have no barriers nor signs but it is obvious that the border 
    exists.<br>
    <br>
    Example: The action* of marking the invisible border carried out in Mostar 
    in 1996, Bosnia and Hercegovina * Armin (18), division line between east and 
    west Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina <strong><br>

    </strong>In 
    this action APSOLUTNO used official certified documents (used in Yugoslavia) 
    - permissions for transport of animals outside of the country. The forms were 
    filled with the data referring to people of various professions, such as:<br>

    0004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In memoriam <a name="im"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    </strong>The starting point for IN MEMORIAM, a project 
    realized on the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of Austria, was taken from 
    the recent history of the Balkans. IN MEMORIAM is based on a parallel drawn 
    between two important events in Austrian and Yugoslav history: the assassination 
    of Prince Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, and the assassination of King 
    Aleksandar Karadjor|evic in Marseilles in 1934.<br>
    Two authentic banknotes from the perid, the Austrian Crown and the Yugoslav 
    Dinar, were used in this project. APSOLUTNO exchanged both the images of the 
    monarchs and their respective coats of arms on the banknotes. In this way 
    two new bank notes, the APSOLUTNO Crown and the APSOLUTNO Dinar were created. 
    The exchange rate between the two currencies was then determined and entered 
    into the official currency list of one of the Austrian banks. According to 
    the list, these two currencies are of equal value.<br>
    IN MEMORIAM was first presented at the Merzweckbau Symposium in Schrattenberg, 
    Austria in 1996.<strong><br>

    exhibitions in Belgrade. As the basis of its intervention the association 
    APSOLUTNO chose plastic notice-board with the data such as working hours, 
    which can be usually found on the entrance doors of stores, offices, galleries 
    etc. </p>
  <p align="left">The

    &nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="at"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    </strong>Is 
    it possible to determine the borderline between the temporary and the permanent? 
    That question instigated this project. The project is centred around the bridge 
    on the 1261 kilometer downstream the Danube, which connects Petrovaradin and 
    Novi Sad (Vojvodina, Yugoslavia). The bridge was built in 1945 as a temporary 
    solution and the intention behind it was to replace it with a new, bigger 
    and more beautiful one. Various circumstances got in the way and prolonged 
    its temporary character till nowadays.* Finally by placing the memorial plaque 
    42 years later (1987) the bridge was inaugurated in the &quot;Marshal Tito&#8217;s 
    Bridge&quot; and transformed into an object of permanent historical value. 
    However the plaque disappeared two years afterwards. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    association APSOLUTNO recognized the story about the bridge as a universal 
    illustration of an absolutely temporary condition and as a platform for re-examining 
    the relations between temporariness and permanence of things. </p>
  <p align="left">As 
    a part of the project APSOLUTNO performed a ceremony during which a new plaque 
    with the inscription &quot;Absolutely temporary&quot; was unveiled. </p>
  <p align="left">* 
    The bridge was destroyed during a NATO air attack on 1 April 1999.

    </strong>A 
    photo action of marking the four remaining objects on the Athenian Acropolis 
    on January 1, 1996</p>
  <p align="left">Throughout 
    the history this place has changed its function and character. During the 
    numerous attempts to conquer Athens, it suffered considerable damage, but 
    in spite of that it has still continued to be one of the most significant 
    monuments of European civilization and one of the most popular tourist attractions 
    in the world.</p>
  <p align="left">However, 
    the largest part of the complex is artificial, which can be illustrated by 
    numerous facts. The maintenance of the object close to the original condition 
    is being achieved by the &quot;temporary architecture&quot; and teams of experts 
    and archeologists from all over the world are working on it. It is well know 
    that, for example, the Caryatids on Erechtheum, the friezes on the Temple 
    of Athena Nike, as well as that most of the huge stone block are not original.</p>
  <p align="left">On 
    the other hand, pollution and industrial waste present an acute global problem. 
    Acid rains have done more damage in the last couple of decades to the objects 
    on the plateau of Acropolis than the last 2500 years. The alarming state of 
    the monuments prompted organizations for the protection of monuments of culture 
    to invest in the conservation of the monuments. But the conservation is performed 
    as plagiarism, and monuments are redone in modern and more resilient materials. 
    Thus saved from further deterioration, monuments are subject to new readings 
    and interpretations.</p>
  <p align="left">The 
    association APSOLUTNO chose Athenian Acropolis as a clear example of the ambivalent 
    initiative of the governing political structures who by conserving the monuments 
    of culture, transform them into the monuments of the civilizational progress. 
    Such processes of fabrication of artificial ambients which are presented to 
    the public as historical artifacts correspond to the basic principles of VR. 
    Using this sophisticated method of deceit, centres of power create even greater 
    manouvring space with the absolute victory of capital as their ultimate goal.</p>

    remaining four objects at the same time symbolize the last four years till 
    the end of the century and millennium.<br>

    I AM ABSOLUTELY EVERY MOMENT ABSOLUTELY HERE<br>
    <br>
    This 
    project was inspired by the theory of a group of physicists active at the 
    beginning of the 20th century which believed that comprehensive reality consisted 
    of spatially discrete elements connected by intrinsic non-local ties. Einstein 
    did not accept this theory; he carried out conceptually the EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) 
    experiment in order to prove that non-local ties did not exist and that there 
    were hidden variables which humankind was still not capable of discovering. 
    However, he proved precisely the opposite, paradoxically shaking his own understanding 
    of quantum physics. The result of this experiment - which was later carried 
    out by Bell - proved that two electrons rotating in opposite directions present 
    an indivisible whole connected by interdependent links into an absolute unity 
    regardless of how distant they are from each other. The sculptural nature 
    of such a system cannot be comprehended in terms of discrete elements. Both 
    particles of the rotat<br>
    ing electron connect by momentary non-local ties which surpass our civilizational 
    mental patterns*.<br>
    The 
    sentence - 'I am absolutely every moment absolutely here' - was sent from 
    Sombor to Horn, <br>
    thence to Vienna, and then on to Novi Sad and so completed a circle functioning 
    as a synonym of the absolute. By its cyclical form and its contents this project, 
    in a simple way, formed the territory of the absolute constructed space and 
    the absolute temporal span.<br>
    The 
    project was carried out in 1995 at the end of November through to early December.<br>

    </strong>This 
    project was realized during a three-month stay of the art association APSOLUTNO 
    in Vienna in 1995. It started as a reaction to various aspects and connotations 
    of the environment in which APSOLUTNO found themselves. </p>
  <p align="left">With 
    all its historical connotations, Vienna is connected to Serbian culture in 
    a unique way. One of many events that occurred in Vienna and have had a significant 
    impact on Serbian culture is related to the creation of the Serbian Cyrillic 
    Alphabet - the AZBUKA. Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic (1787-1864), &quot;the creator 
    of the standard Serbian language and literature&quot;*, printed the first 
    Dictionary of the Serbian language using the AZBUKA in 1818. AZBUKA is still 
    used as one of the two official alphabets in Yugoslavia. The Dictionary was 
    printed in the Mechitharisten Monastery printing house in Vienna (Mechitaristengasse 
    4). </p>
  <p align="left">On 
    the city map of Vienna, APSOLUTNO pointed out all thirty letters of the AZBUKA, 
    formed by the directions of the streets. This was followed by an action in 
    which APSOLUTNO, with the permission and the assistance of the Viennese police, 
    blocked the traffic in these streets with a yellow emergency ribbon. At the 
    same time, each house or building in the streets comprising the &quot;letters&quot; 
    was marked with a label with the following text in German: &quot;This house 
    absolutely lives in the letter ...&quot;. The labels had the same layout as 
    the street-name plates in Vienna, and were written in the same letter font. 
    Finally, a brochure about the action was printed in the Mechitharisten Monastery, 
    in the same printing house in which Vuk Stefanovic Karadzic's Dictionary was 
    originally printed in 1818. </p>
  <p align="left">An 
    integral part of the project is a version of the first German - Serbian Dictionary 
    published by Jovan Kangrga in 1928. In this 'Dictionary', all words have been 
    erased; only the punctuation marks remained, in their original positions. 
    Five copies of the dictionary were made. </p>
  <p align="left">This 
    project was conducted during the war in former Yugoslavia, when, due to the 
    UN sanctions against F.R. Yugoslavia (of which Serbia is a part), communication 
    between Austria and Serbia became extremely difficult. By blocking the traffic 
    in the streets of Vienna and erasing the words from the original dictionary, 
    APSOLUTNO referred to the block in communications between Austria and Serbia, 
    in spite of a long tradition of strong cultural links between the two countries.    </p>

    of a death of two transoceanic liners under suspicious circumstances. They 
    are found in Novi Sad, Vojvodina, Yugoslavia, between the 1,258th and 1,259th 
    kilometre of the Danube. The ships lie parralel to each other with their bows 
    turned towards the south-west. The ships are 105 metres long and 16.2 metres 
    wide. The main deck is 9 metres high on both ships. Their cargo capacity is 
    5,700 tons. There are no visible traces or signs on the spot which undoubtedly 
    indicate a certain cause of death. The position of the ships, as well as the 
    place and time they were found in, indicate an absolutely death. The investigation 
    was conducted on 21 September 1995, from 6 pm to 9.30 pm.</p>

    Time: July, 1995, war on the territory of ex-Yugoslavia; 
    sanctions and media blockade; absolute control of the media by the political 
    regime in Belgrade. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    object of action was a newspaper kiosk out of function. Through the glass 
    panes of the kiosk one could see a brick wall. This form of &quot;remodeling&quot; 
    was a common occurrence at the time of the severest economic crisis in Yugoslavia 
    during the nineties. It was a way to avoid paying building permits and taxes. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    association APSOLUTNO put the sign NEWS[PAPER] on the door and thus &quot;reactivated&quot; 
    the kiosk. With the sign NEWS[PAPER] the whole situation, including the place 
    and time gained a completely different connotation. The text accompanying 
    the photograph is the quotation on censorship taken from the encyclopedia 
    in the edition of the Leksografski zavod, Zagreb, 1966. </p>
  <p align="left">Newspapers 
    have always been subjugated by the authority in power [unless, of course, 
    the paper in question is the mouthpiece of the authorities]; the Establishment 
    jealously guards the privilege of controlling and censoring what is printed 
    or published. One of North America's greatest journalists, Benjamin Franklin, 
    had to cease publication of his newspapers several times under the coersion 
    of royal censorship. </p>
  <p align="left">The 
    French Revolution gave powerful impetus to the development of journalism; 
    revolutionary ideas and social upheaval provoked the interest of the masses. 
    Newspapers became a weapon in the struggle against the ancien r&eacute;gime 
    and their number significantly increased during the first years of the Revolution. 
    However, Napoleon's regime suppressed the freedom of press and permitted only 
    semi-official papers to circulate in the areas under rule. The restoration 
    of the &quot;legitimate&quot; monarchy and the Holy Alliance did not herald 
    the reinstatement of the freedom of press: newspapers were prohibited from 
    addressing political issues candidly. </p>

    </strong>The 
    installation addresses the issue of war and presents it as a circus arena.    </p>
  <p align="left">0n 
    the front wall there are two shotguns, one below the other, in a broken position. 
    The upper one is ready to be reloaded and used again, while the lower one 
    is completely broken and unfit for usage. In that position they also form 
    the visual archetype of the military insignia. The floor is covered with saw 
    dust and metaphorically it brings into focus the territory of the whole region 
    and puts it on the level of the circus ring.</p>
  <p align="left">The 
    installation was realized for the first time on May 25, 1995, the date which 
    was celebrated in x-Yugoslavia as the birthday of the president Josip Broz 
    Tito&#8224;. </p>
  <p align="left">For 
    the second time the installation was realized at Kwangju Bienniale in 1997, 
    Hybrid section, but with important alterations: the shotguns in the installation 
    which were taken from the Kwangju police archive had been used in the government&#8217;s 
    retaliation on the citizens who took part in the revolution in South Korea 
    in 1980.<br>
