    </strong><font color="#666666">The project HUMAN is focused on the global 
    events on the European territory. Marking the borderline which divides Europe 
    into East and West is in the basis of the project. This borderline has a long 
    history during which it has gone through a number of changes, but its meaning 
    always prevailed. This borderline exists as an invisible curtain which either 
    tolerates or prevents different forms of communication on various levels. 
    Since 1989 and the fall of the Berlin wall, we have been witnesses of a geopolitical 
    regrouping followed by the disappearance of borders between the states in 
    the western part and the establishment of the new &quot;united&quot; Europe, 
    while in the eastern part a multitude of new nationalistic states with strictly 
    controlled borders were formed. In this action the association APSOLUTNO marked 
    the above mentioned line (WE-EE) by placing a traffic sign with the inscription 
    &quot;MAN&quot; on no-man&#8217;s-land between the borders of the countries 
    along the line. Thus the association pointed out the (in)equality of PEOPLE 
    and their destinies in both of these entities of European territory. The word 
    HUMAN which is on the signs, is written in the official languages of the neighbouring 
    countries.<br>
    <br>
    The invisible borders<br>
    <br>
    Apart from marking the borderlines which divide Europe, parallel part of the 
    project HUMAN is recognition and marking of the &quot;invisible&quot; lines 
    which divide a geographical whole or an urban entity. The divisions instigated 
    by war, economic, legal, political or cultural disputes, cause a form of (un)communicativeness 
    between people. These borders carry psychological weight because unlike official 
    borders they have no barriers nor signs but it is obvious that the border 
    exists.<br>
    <br>
    Example: The action* of marking the invisible border carried out in Mostar 
    in 1996, Bosnia and Hercegovina * Armin (18), division line between east and 
    west Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina </font><strong><br>
